The round-shaped dish has taken different forms, but nothing comes to the satisfaction of pulling a slice of pizza topped with cheese and choice of vegetables or meat.Speaking of its origins, Dhaval Udeshi, Co-founder of Chrome Hospitality, says, “Ever been curious to know about the origin of the modern day pizza – how it came to be and some of its original toppings? As random as it may look like, pizza has a vibrant history. Pizza as we know it today has been around for three or so centuries. As early as the 3rd century, our forefathers would blend bread with varieties of toppings. So, we could trace pizza roots back to ancient times.",

These are used for the ECG and to complete the body composition measurement. Using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, the Body Scan will assess body fat, visceral fat, bone and muscle mass, and water percentage to provide readings for individual body parts.

description:"A giant, glowing X marks the San Francisco spot where Elon Musk says he plans to keep his company, the messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter. But city officials and some residents are unhappy with the display.On Friday, the company erected an “X” logo on the roof of its Market Street headquarters, to the chagrin of neighbors who complained about intrusive lights, and San Francisco’s Department of Building Inspection which said it is investigating the structure.The move followed a post from Musk, the enigmatic billionaire who acquired the company in October for $44 billion, announcing the newly named firm would remain in San Francisco despite what he termed the city’s recent “doom spiral, with one company after another left or leaving.",

   description:"Earlier this year, Google announced that it was working with Apple on a new safety feature called ‘Unknown Tracker Alerts’ which can notify users about unwanted Bluetooth trackers travelling with them.While Bluetooth trackers like AirTags and Tiles are often used to track or find lost items, many have used them for stalking other people and committing crimes like planned car theft.Available on devices running Android 6 Marshmellow or later, the Unknown Tracker Alerts feature works by sending users a notification if it finds a Bluetooth tracker that does not belong to them is travelling with them.If you want more details, just tap on the notification and you will be able to see the location on a map which shows when the tracker started following them. Users can also reveal the serial number and information of the owner by bringing the tracker near the back of their phone. In case you want to locate the tracker without notifying the owner, use the ‘Play Sound’ option.",

description:"Until very recently, this demonstration, which I witnessed during a podcast interview at Google’s robotics division in Mountain View, California, last week, would have been impossible. Robots weren’t able to reliably manipulate objects they had never seen before, and they certainly weren’t capable of making the logical leap from “extinct animal” to “plastic dinosaur.”But a quiet revolution is underway in robotics, one that piggybacks on recent advances in so-called large language models — the same type of artificial intelligence system that powers ChatGPT, Bard and other chatbots.Google has recently begun plugging state-of-the-art language models into its robots, giving them the equivalent of artificial brains. The secretive project has made the robots far smarter and given them new powers of understanding and problem-solving.",

description:"ISRO successfully launched its proven PSLV rocket carrying seven Singaporean satellites Sunday from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh and placed them into intended orbits.Around 23 minutes after lift-off, the primary satellite got separated and it was followed by six other co-passenger satellites, which were deployed into the intended orbits sequentially, ISRO said.On the successful launch and separation of the satellites, ISRO posted on Twitter, “PSLV-C56/DS-SAR Mission: The mission is successfully accomplished. PSLV-C56 vehicle launched all seven satellites precisely into their intended orbits. Thanks to @NSIL_India and Singapore, for the contract.” This ISRO mission, which comes after the much-awaited Chandrayaan-3 launch earlier this month, is being undertaken by its commercial arm NewSpace India Limited.",

description:"LinkedIn is working on a new AI tool that could make job hunting easier and more efficient, according to a new leak. The tool, called LinkedIn Coach, is a chatbot that can assist users with various aspects of their career development, such as applying for jobs, learning new skills, and networking with others.The screenshot shared by Owji suggests users ask the chatbot things like “How does Coach work?” or “What is the culture of Microsoft?” It seems inevitable that AI-powered assistants would eventually find their way to the professional social platform, given that it is a subsidiary of Microsoft.LinkedIn has been investing heavily in generative AI it seems — coach is not the first AI-powered feature that the platform has introduced. The company has been constantly adding generative AI features that can help users create and improve their profiles, resumes, and cover letters. For instance, LinkedIn has a resume builder tool that can generate a resume based on the user’s profile information. It also has a cover letter assistance tool that can provide suggestions and examples for writing a cover letter.",

description:"Keeping your underwear clean on Earth is easy enough. You can use washing machines or even manually wash them. But what about astronauts who go on long-term space missions? Washing spacesuits is not practical and sometimes, they might have to share the inner lining of the suits they use. The European Space Agency (ESA) is working on anti-microbial solutions that can be used in space.The agency’s PExTEx project, which stands for Planetary Exploration Textiles, assesses suitable textiles for future spacesuit design. The most obvious dangers for astronauts in space come from outside—extreme temperature, space radiation and highly abrasive dust.The most obvious hazards are the external ones: moonwalkers venturing out of lunar bases will have to contend not only with hard vacuum but also wild temperature extremes, space radiation and highly abrasive dust – which partially jammed the seals of Apollo spacesuits within just a few hours of exposure while compromising their outermost layers.",

description:"Some folks spend their days fretting over their fate in the great beyond, but they’re missing the real question: what will become of their browser history when they die? Imagine the horror of your nosy partner discovering your online indulgences, shattering the saintly image you worked so hard to maintain. With a new feature on Opera GX, these worries will be a thing of the past.The browser has announced a new feature that will help users preserve their online reputation after death. Called “Fake My History,” the feature automatically replaces your guilty pleasures with wholesome and respectable searches such as “local volunteer opportunities”, “free online courses for personal growth”, “how to encourage voting in my community”, and “how to build a birdhouse”.Here’s how it works: After 14 days of inactivity, Opera GX makes the assumption of your passing and quickly gets to work, replacing your not-so-proud moments with carefully selected, pre-defined set of various URLs. There’s no pressure, though – the feature is optional and can be enabled or disabled from the browser settings.",

Also, a nuclear thermal engine would have a higher payload capacity while providing higher power that can be used for instruments and communications.",

He led the analysis of unexplained anomalous phenomena (UAP, an official US government term for UFOs) within the Department of Defense until recently.He also goes on to claim that he has been denied access to secret government UFO programs and that he knows of “people who have been harmed or injured” during the government’s efforts to conceal UFO information.",

While 14 cheetahs — seven males, six females and one female cub — are kept in the bomas in Kuno, a female cheetah is out in the open and is being intensively monitored by a team. Efforts are on to bring her back to the boma for a health examination",

Users can also reveal the serial number and information of the owner by bringing the tracker near the back of their phone. In case you want to locate the tracker without notifying the owner, use the ‘Play Sound’ option.",
